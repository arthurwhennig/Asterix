# Simulation mode interface
    
    In this part the user will be capable of seeing a defence configuration run. For this we calculate the new trajectory(not visible to the user) of the asteroid/meteor and let the asteroid/meteor follow the trajectory at a speed such that the simulation might take about 30 to 60 seconds. 

## Adjusting speed
    If the user wishes to stop the simulation or adjust the speed we will have a stop/play button and a speed (1x, 2x, 3x, 4x) button. 

## Simulating 
    Before the simulation runs visibly for the user we have already calculated the new trajectory and we will simply display the asteroid/meteor following the said trajectory.
    If the meteor/asteroid impacts on earth, we will have calculated the impact location and the direct and secondary consequences of the impact. With the direct being the crater and fireblast and the secondary being earthquakes and tsunamis. We will also calculate the population damage based on the population density around the crater. 
    After the **impact visualizations** we will display on overview of how well the users job was. This will be a factor of cost (from buying defence items in the shop) and a factor of consequences for humanity. This we will rate as completed or uncompleted as well as give a score from 1 to 3 stars for completed simulations.
