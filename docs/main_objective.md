# Accurate simulation of asteroid impacts
    The absolute main objective is to create a scientifically accurate simulation tool that allows for concrete asteroid impact predicitions and secondary consquences such as earthquakes and tsunamis. 
    The tool is supposed to be educational and provide decision-support for asteroid risk management. 

    It is essential that the focus still lies on the threat asteroids could serve. 
    Thus we must have the create-your-own mode be one of the main points in the application

    The NASA NEO(near earth object) API will be essential in identifying the asteroids that pose potential threats and simulating their impacts.
