# Defence mode interface
    The defence mode allows the user to see the projected trajectory of the asteroid/meteor. The user can place the defence mechanisms (gravity tractors, shields) in space. The trajectory of the asteroid/meteor will not be altered in this interface. This will only happen once the user stars the simulation. 

## Defence components
    Each of the components comes with a cost that represents how much this would cost in the real world. The grand total will appear on the top right of the screen. 

## SHOP
    The user can open the shop such that a bar with the defence items and their respective costs appears on the bottom of the screen. The user can select them from the shop.

## Placement
    Once the user selects a defence item from the shop it can be place in space. This can be done by first selecting and clicking once on the location. The object can still be moved finely using the arrow keys. After that the location can be confirmed using a green confirm button to the bottom right of the screen.

## Saving config
    The current configuration of the user will be stored every time a new element is placed or an old one is moved. If the user wishes to start of from scratch, there must be a reset button present. 
    We will store the data of started defence configurations for at least 1 day, after that we do not guarantee saved progress unless the simulation was run with said configuration, in which case we will store the last 3 run simulations. 

## Running simulation
    There will be a button that allows for the user to test it's defence configuration. On click we will take the user to simulation mode.
