- Calculate the kinetic impact energy and use the USGS data sets to model secondary consequences:
    - approximate radius 
    - find volume 
    - use density to find the mass 
    - use the impact velocity to approximate the kinetic energy 
formulas:
radius = diameter / 2
Volume = 4/3 * radius^3 * pi
mass = density * volume
kinetic energy = 1/2 * mass * (impact_velocity)^2
