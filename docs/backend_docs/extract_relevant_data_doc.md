# Sources to extract from
## NASA NEO API 
    - Impactor diameter: estimated size of asteroid
    - Impactor velocity: asteroids speed relative to earth
## USgS 
    - Geological Maps: Extract the target surface density (e.g., rock, soil) for the chosen impact location.
    - Digital Elevation Models (DEMs): Get high-resolution elevation data for the area. This is critical for modeling tsunami inundation and airblast effects over terrain.
    - Fault Line Maps: Extract the locations of nearby seismic faults to analyze the potential for triggered earthquakes.
    - PAGER (Prompt Assessment of Global Earthquakes for Response): Use this system to model the ground shaking and potential damage after you calculate the earthquake's magnitude.
## NOAA
    - Bathymetry Data (e.g., GEBCO datasets): Extract the ocean depth at the exact point of impact. This is crucial for the tsunami wave calculation.
## NASA SEDAC
    - population data for regions that the effects will cover 
## needed without current source
    - Infrastructure Data (e.g., from OpenStreetMap or specific government portals): Extract the locations of cities, roads, power plants, and other critical structures.
