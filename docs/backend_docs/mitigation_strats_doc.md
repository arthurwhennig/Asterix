# Mitigation Strategies for asteroid impact 

This directory contains the strategies used to defend the earth from alien asteroids. These strategies are used in seperate cases, which we also define. 

## Overview

The 3 main types of mitigation strategies are: 

**Kinetic Impactor** - spacecraft designed to intentionally collide with an asteroid or other near-Earth object (NEO) to alter its trajectory

**Nuclear Disruption** - fragments a potentially hazardous asteroid into many smaller, less threatening pieces

**Gravity Tractors** - A technique using spacecrafts that essentially tows the asteroid onto a new, non-threatening trajectory without ever physically touching it.


## When do I use which strategy? 

### Kinetic Impactor: 
#### Warning Time: Medium (a few years to a couple of decades). It needs enough time for a spacecraft to travel to the asteroid and for the resulting change in trajectory to be sufficient to miss Earth.
#### Asteroid Size: Small to medium. It's ideal for deflecting asteroids up to a few hundred meters in diameter. A larger asteroid would require a much bigger impactor or multiple impacts.
#### Composition: Best for solid or well-consolidated asteroids. The impact creates a crater and blasts debris into space (ejecta), which gives an extra push. This effect is less predictable on a loosely-held-together rubble pile.

### Laser Ablation:

#### Warning Time: Medium to long (several years to decades). Laser ablation is significantly faster and more powerful than a gravity tractor but slower than a kinetic impactor
#### Asteroid Size: Asteroid Size: Small to medium. It's most effective on asteroids up to a few hundred meters in diameter. While more powerful than a gravity tractor, it lacks the brute force of a kinetic impactor needed for very large objects.
#### Composition: Most effective on asteroids with volatile materials, but works on any type. If the asteroid contains ices or other materials that vaporize easily, the laser can create more thrust with less energy. However, a key advantage is its precision; it can be used on a loosely-held-together "rubble pile" without the risk of shattering it unpredictably, which is a major concern for a kinetic impactor.

### Gravity Tractor:

#### Warning Time: Very long (20+ years). Its effect is extremely slow, relying on the tiny gravitational pull of a spacecraft over many years.
#### Asteroid Size: Small to medium. While it could theoretically work on any size, moving a large asteroid would require a prohibitively massive spacecraft or multiple tractors.
#### Composition: Any kind. It's effective on solid bodies, loosely-held-together "rubble piles," and fast-spinning asteroids because it pulls on the entire mass without contact.
