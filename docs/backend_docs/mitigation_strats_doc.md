# Mitigation Strategies for asteroid impact 

This directory contains the strategies used to defend the earth from alien asteroids. These strategies are used in seperate cases, which we also define. 

## Overview

The 3 main types of mitigation strategies are: 

**Kinetic Impactor** - spacecraft designed to intentionally collide with an asteroid or other near-Earth object (NEO) to alter its trajectory

**Nuclear disruption** - fragments a potentially hazardous asteroid into many smaller, less threatening pieces
