# Mitigation Strategies for asteroid impact 

This directory contains the strategies used to defend the earth from alien asteroids. These strategies are used in seperate cases, which we also define. 

## Overview

The 3 main types of mitigation strategies are: 

**Kinetic Impactor** - spacecraft designed to intentionally collide with an asteroid or other near-Earth object (NEO) to alter its trajectory

**Nuclear Disruption** - fragments a potentially hazardous asteroid into many smaller, less threatening pieces

**Gravity Tractors** - A technique using spacecrafts that essentially tows the asteroid onto a new, non-threatening trajectory without ever physically touching it.


## When do I use which strategy? 

### Kinetic Impactor: 
#### Warning Time: Medium (a few years to a couple of decades). It needs enough time for a spacecraft to travel to the asteroid and for the resulting change in trajectory to be sufficient to miss Earth.
#### Asteroid Size: Small to medium. It's ideal for deflecting asteroids up to a few hundred meters in diameter. A larger asteroid would require a much bigger impactor or multiple impacts.
#### Composition: Best for solid or well-consolidated asteroids. The impact creates a crater and blasts debris into space (ejecta), which gives an extra push. This effect is less predictable on a loosely-held-together rubble pile.

### Nuclear Deflection
#### Warning Time: Very short (months to a few years). This is the only strategy that can potentially work when an impact is imminent.
#### Asteroid Size: Very large (over 500 meters) or city-killers. The immense energy from a nuclear device is the only thing powerful enough to deal with the biggest threats.
#### Composition: Any, but with a major risk. The goal is to shatter the asteroid into many small, harmless fragments. However, there's a serious risk of the "shotgun effect"â€”breaking it into several large chunks that could still hit Earth, possibly causing even more widespread damage.
