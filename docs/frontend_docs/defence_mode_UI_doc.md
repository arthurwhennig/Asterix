# Frontend UI/UX Specification: Planetary Defense Mode

This document details the UI/UX for the **Planetary Defense Mode** of the Asterix platform.  
This mode transforms the impact viewer into an interactive, strategic simulation where users deploy assets to mitigate or prevent an asteroid impact.

---

## 1. Core Layout & Mode Transition

- **Mode Activation**: The user selects *Defense Mode* from the main header, which triggers a UI transition.  
  The color scheme shifts to a more urgent "alert" theme (e.g., amber or blue highlights), and the panel contents change.

- **Central Viewport**: The CesiumJS globe remains the central focus, but the initial view is zoomed out to a strategic, solar-system scale, showing Earth, the Moon, and the inbound asteroid's general trajectory.

## 2. Left Sidebar: Mission Briefing & Asset Deployment

This panel is the command center for the defense mission.

### Section 1: Threat Assessment

- **UI**: The user is presented with a list of pre-defined threat scenarios.

**Options:**  
- *Historical Threats*: Tunguska, Chelyabinsk (re-imagined as future threats).  
- *Future PHOs (Potentially Hazardous Objects)*: Apophis (2029 Flyby), Bennu (Future Risk).  

**Interaction:** Selecting a threat loads its data and displays its nominal trajectory‚Äîa dashed, ominous red line showing the potential path to an Earth impact.

**Targeting Control:** A slider labeled *"Adjust Impact Corridor"* allows the user to subtly modify the asteroid's trajectory to target different regions on Earth, creating varied challenges.

### Section 2: Strategic Asset Deployment

This is the core interactive component of Defense Mode.

- **Budget Display**: A prominent progress bar at the top of the panel shows the user's available budget (e.g., `$500B / $1,000B`).

- **Asset Arsenal**: A palette of available defense mechanisms, each with an icon, name, and cost.

#### Available Assets:
These will be able to be selected as a horizontal bar on the bottom of the screen:
- üöÄ **Kinetic Impactor**: A sleek, arrow-like spacecraft.  
- üî¶ **Laser Ablation**: A high-tech satellite with a large primary mirror or phased array emitter.  
- üõ∞Ô∏è **Gravity Tractor**: A bulky, powerful-looking spacecraft with prominent spherical masses.  

 **Deployment Interaction Flow**  
 - User clicks an asset from the arsenal (e.g., *"Kinetic Impactor"*).  
 - The selected asset‚Äôs box is surrounded by a **fading green highlight**, providing visual feedback for the current choice.  
 - The asset icon is attached to the mouse cursor.  
 - The user moves the cursor over the hull of the Earth
 - The user can place the defence item on click
 - The grand total cost will be recalculated
 - The user can remove already placed objects by clicking on them which will open a menu on the top right of the screen that gives information of the placed geolocation and lets the user the delete the placed item

## 3. Central 3D Viewport: The Strategic View

- **Initial State**: Earth and Moon are visible. The asteroid's potential impact trajectory is shown as a dashed red line.  
  *(Final impact point is hidden ‚Äì only the path is visible.)*

- **Placing Assets**: When a defense asset is deployed, its 3D model appears along the hull of the earth
  

- **Focus**: No cinematic impact visuals during planning.

## 4. Right Sidebar: Mission Success Prediction & Report Card

This panel provides a detailed, layered score after execution.

### Post-Simulation: Mission Report Card

Triggered by the **EXECUTE DEFENSE PLAN** button.
**The asteroid**:
- Simulate the outcome of the asteroids trajectory based on placed defence mechanism. This shows the asteroid moving through space. 

After the asteroid has hit Earth or has gone by the following will be displayed:

**Section 1: Mission Summary (Always Visible)**  
- Outcome: *SUCCESS* / *FAILURE*  
- Final Score: ‚≠ê 0‚Äì3 stars  
- Justification text (e.g., ‚Äú‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Perfect Score! Threat neutralized under budget.‚Äù)

**Performance Evaluation:**  
- Total Cost  
- Consequences Mitigated (e.g., `100% - Full Prevention`, `85% - Impact shifted to unpopulated ocean`).

**Section 2: Detailed Consequence Analysis (Expandable, Optional based on impact/no impact)**  
- Seismic: Magnitude, Shaking Zones  
- Social: Casualties, Displaced Population  
- Economic: Property Loss, Disruption  
- Tsunami (conditional): Wave Height, Coastal Flooding  
- Environmental: Dust, Wildfire Radius

## 5. Bottom Bar: The Execution Button

- **Timeline**: Disabled during planning phase.  
- **Primary Action Button**:  
  - `EXECUTE DEFENSE PLAN`  
  - Locks in the choices, runs final simulation, and generates the Mission Report Card.
